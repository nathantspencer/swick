Do you work with SWC files?
---------------------------

If you do, you've probably found that even simple tasks—finding a disconnected node, adjusting positions, combining structures—can become a slog.
The goal of ``swick`` is to simplify these tasks and make working with SWC files downright fun.


Never heard of them?
--------------------

The SWC format is a popular way to represent neuron structures.
It essentially defines a list of nodes, each with a three-dimensional position, size, type, and at most one parent node.

If you'd like to learn more about the format itself, `NeuronLand's specification <http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html>`_ is a great place to start.

You can also find hundreds of thousands of publicly available reconstructions on `NeuroMorpho.org <https://neuromorpho.org>`_.


Let's get started.
------------------

To install ``swick``, you'll first need `Python <https://python.org>`_ installed and available.

Once you have Python ready, head on over to the :doc:`installation` section to get started.
