`swick` is the slick way to process [SWC files](http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html)—which contain tree-like representations of neuron structures—in Python.

Reading, writing, combining, splitting, and validating SWC files can be done in just a few lines. Objects to represent SWC files are also provided, laying the groundwork for custom analysis or modification of SWCs in Python.

# Installation

To install `swick` via `pip`, simply:

```
pip install swick
```

Or to upgrade an existing installation:

```
pip install swick --upgrade
```
